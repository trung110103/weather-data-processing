# Weather Data Processing

## Overview
This project is designed to process and analyze weather data using **PySpark** and **Docker**. It reads weather data, processes it to calculate the average temperature per hour, and outputs the results. The project is containerized with Docker for easy deployment and reproducibility.

## Features
- Reads weather data from a CSV file or generates dummy data.
- Uses PySpark for distributed data processing.
- Calculates average temperature grouped by hour.
- Deployable via Docker containers.

## Prerequisites
- **Docker**: Installed on your system (https://www.docker.com/get-started).
- **Python 3.11**: Required for PySpark and dependencies.
- **Git**: To clone the repository (https://git-scm.com/downloads).
